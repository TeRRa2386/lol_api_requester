# League of Rankings

This project was developed as part of the "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" course by Dr. Angela Yu. It serves as a personal educational assignment and is not intended for commercial use.

## Description

**League of Rankings** is a web application that displays the top 10 players in various League of Legends regions and ranks. It connects with the official Riot Games API to fetch ranked data and server status in real time.

It also includes background music and dynamic UI elements using Flask and Bootstrap.

## Features

- Top 10 League of Legends players by region, tier, queue, and division.
- Real-time server status display.
- Embedded copyright-free music.
- Responsive layout using Bootstrap 5.

## How to Use

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:**  
> If the website is not working, it's likely because the Riot Games API key expired.  
> Riot provides free developer keys that expire every 24 hours.  
> You can clone this project and replace the API key with your own valid key to test the functionality.  

The API key is loaded from a `.env` file using `python-dotenv`.
